# MarkerAudioSplitter
Split audio files based on project text export of Pro tools (and someday later other DAW's as well)


Here's a true time and effort saver for all Pro tools users: split your bounce based on the markers in the projects with few sipmple clicks. No more selecting the songs one by one and doing bounce for each song separately.

This tool does nothing more to that audio than stated above. And strongly focuses on workflow where bouncing of the same project is done multiple times. So when next time artist asks that "Could you lower the guitars by 2db and then send the songs to me. And please make the songs separated" for the tenth time this day, you can gladly say "Yes, wait a while", click bounce from pro tools for the whole project, go get a coffee/beer/whatever and come back when all is finished

Suited for all levels of use, from amateur to professional usage.
